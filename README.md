Attu is an all-in-one milvus administration tool. With Attu, you can dramatically reduce the cost of managing milvus.

## Quick start guide for Attu

> ‚ùó attu version 2.2.3 or higher is incompatible with Milvus versions < v2.2.

If you prefer to use a desktop application, you can download the [desktop version of Attu](https://github.com/zilliztech/attu/releases/).

### Running Attu from Docker

Before you begin, make sure that you have Milvus installed on either [your server](https://milvus.io/docs/install_cluster-docker.md) or [Zilliz Cloud](https://zilliz.com/cloud). Note that Attu only supports Milvus 2.x and some of the features are not supported yet for Zilliz Cloud.

Here are the steps to start a container for running Attu:

```code
docker run -p 8000:3000 -e MILVUS_URL={milvus server IP}:19530 zilliz/attu:v2.3.5
```

Make sure that the Attu container can access the Milvus IP address. After starting the container, open your web browser and enter `http://{ Attu IP }:8000` to view the Attu GUI.

### Running Attu within Kubernetes

Before you begin, make sure that you have Milvus installed and running within your [K8's Cluster](https://milvus.io/docs/install_cluster-milvusoperator.md). Note that Attu only supports Milvus 2.x.

Here are the steps to start a container for running Attu:

```code
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zilliztech/attu/main/attu-k8s-deploy.yaml
```

Make sure that the Attu pod can access the Milvus service. In the example provided this connects directly to `my-release-milvus:19530`. Change this based on the Milvus service name. A more flexible way to achieve this would be to introduce a `ConfigMap`. See this [example]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zilliztech/attu/main/examples/attu-k8s-deploy-ConfigMap.yaml") for details.

#### Optional Environment Variables for Running Attu Docker

| Parameter        | Example              | Required | Description                             |
| :--------------- | :------------------- | :------: | --------------------------------------- |
| MILVUS_URL       | 192.168.0.1:19530    |  false   | Optional, Milvus server URL             |
| ATTU_LOG_LEVEL   | info                 |  false   | Optional, sets the log level for Attu   |
| ROOT_CERT_PATH   | /path/to/root/cert   |  false   | Optional, path to the root certificate  |
| PRIVATE_KEY_PATH | /path/to/private/key |  false   | Optional, path to the private key       |
| CERT_CHAIN_PATH  | /path/to/cert/chain  |  false   | Optional, path to the certificate chain |
| SERVER_NAME      | your_server_name     |  false   | Optional, name of your server           |

> Please note that the `MILVUS_URL` should be an address that the Attu Docker container can access. Therefore, "127.0.0.1" or "localhost" will not work.

To run the Docker container with these environment variables, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -e MILVUS_URL=192.168.0.1:19530 -e ATTU_LOG_LEVEL=info -e ROOT_CERT_PATH=/path/to/root/cert -e PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/path/to/private/key -e CERT_CHAIN_PATH=/path/to/cert/chain -e SERVER_NAME=your_server_name zilliz/attu:v2.3.5
```
